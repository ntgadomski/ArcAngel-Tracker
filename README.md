-Below is the Raspberry Pi device that was used to manipulate the aircraft data. Connected to the Pi is a radio frequency filter
and reciever that was provided by our sponsor through flightaware.

-Below is an example of the finished prototype of our AirTrack project running on the Rasberry Pi hardware. The Python coding
language was used along with the Thonny IDE due to it being lightweight. The program/GUI is set to refresh every 10 seconds to gain
the closest aircraft compared to the user's current location.
